# Text Mining R

This project was built as part of a master's dissertation.
The main goal was to perform a sentiment analysis over social media reviews.

To explore data was first made a part-of-speech analysis and then was aplied a clustering analysis through Correlated topic Model (Blei,2007) and BTM (Yan et al., 2013).
After that, all unstructured data was prepared until it was ready for the application of data mining algorithms.
The data mining algorithms were applied to the DTM matrix using IBM Modeler.

The content provided here contains code built by myself and as well code from other sources adapted to my needs.
